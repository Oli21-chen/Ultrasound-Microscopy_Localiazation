# Bubble_Localization_SR
individual project-updating
1. original network structure  -encoderdecoder
2. Different architecture  - skip connection/ residual connection
3. 0% overlap of patches  - cutting image/ concatenation


In final version:
  1. X_train needs to normalize before training, Y_train does not
  2. Binaraize label image - depends
  3. Different training data require fine-tuning parameters
